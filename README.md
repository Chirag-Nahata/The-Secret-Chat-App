### Simple. Secure. Reliable messaging.

Send and receive high-fidelity messages, participate in HD voice/video calls, and explore a growing set of new features that help you stay connected. Secret Chat’s advanced privacy-preserving technology is always enabled, so you can focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to you.

• Simple - Secret Chat is so simple you already know how to use it.

• Reliable Messaging - Message your friends and family for free.

• Groups to keep in touch - Keep in touch with the groups of people that matter the most, like your family or coworkers. With group chats, you can share messages, photos, and videos with people. You can also name your group, mute or customize notifications, and more.

• Say anything – State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption and can self-destruct keeps your conversations secure. Privacy isn’t an optional mode — it’s just the way that Secret Chat works. Every message, every call, every time. Secret Chat keeps your messages safe from hacker attacks. When end-to-end encrypted, your messages and calls are secured so only you and the person you're communicating with can read or listen to them, and nobody in between, not even Secret Chat. Secret Chat uses your phone's Internet connection to send messages so you can avoid SMS fees.

• Go fast – Messages are delivered quickly and reliably, even on slow networks. Secret Chat is optimized to operate in the most constrained environment possible.

• Share Moments that Matter - Send photos and videos on Secret Chat instantly. You can even capture the moments that matter to you most with a built-in camera.

• Say What's On Your Mind - Sometimes, your voice says it all. With just one tap you can record a Voice Message, perfect for a quick hello or a longer story.

Document Sharing Made Easy - Send PDFs, documents, spreadsheets, slideshows and more, without the hassle of email or file sharing apps. So it's easy to get what you need over to who you want.

• Feel free – Secret Chat is a completely independent nonprofit. Development is supported by users like you. No advertisements. No trackers. No kidding.

• Be yourself – You can use your existing phone number and address book to securely communicate with your friends.

• Speak up – Whether they live across town or across the ocean, Secret Chat’s enhanced audio and video quality will make your friends and family feel closer. With voice calls, you can talk to your friends and family for free, even if they're in another country. And with free video calls, you can have face-to-face conversations for when voice or text just isn't enough. Secret Chat voice and video calls use your phone's Internet connection, instead of your cell plan's voice minutes, so you don't have to worry about expensive calling charges.

• Whisper in the shadows – Switch to the dark theme if you refuse to see the light.

• Sound familiar – Choose custom alerts for each contact, or disable noises completely.

• Picture this – Use the built-in image editing features to sketch, crop, and flip your outgoing photos. There’s even a text tool so that you can add more words to the 1,000 that your picture is already worth.

• Expressive - Telegram lets you completely customize your messenger.
